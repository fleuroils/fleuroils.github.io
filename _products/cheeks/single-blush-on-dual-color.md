Our matte, dual-color powder blushes are the talk of the town! Choose from light/bright peach, tan/brown, and light/dark pinkâ€”you can use each shade separately or blend both together (just swirl your Fashion 21 Blush-on Brush to mix) for that just-right shade. The tan/brown set is also perfect for contouring!
