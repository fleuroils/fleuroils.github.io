Say goodbye to long sleeves, pants, and skirts on hot days! Despite its name, this product is more than just for your legs—it’s great for arms and stretch marks too (rejoice, mommies!). This non-greasy foundation provides amazingly heavy coverage, evens out skin tone, and minimizing scars and dark areas. It’s made of an enhanced waterproof formula that contains tea tree oil to banish blemishes and Pearl-Shine to give your skin a bright, healthy glow. Just apply, blend, and leave to dry or seal with Fashion 21 loose powder for maximum effect
