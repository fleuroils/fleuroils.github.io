Aqualicious feels more like a balm than a lipstick—it’s amazingly moisturizing and contains Vitamin E—but it still provides the rich color of a normal lipstick. This product is perfect for lips that go dry during the day, and it’s available in a wide range of 10 different colors—from pink to nude—to fit any social event.
