Eyelashes need conditioning as much as our crowning glory does to soften and, in some cases, even thicken and lengthen them. This water-resistant mascara gives you the conditioning you need while giving your eyes the usual oomph. The clear shade even promotes that “no mascara” look because it’s not obvious that you’ve got product on, and doubles as an eyebrow gel to help in grooming and to prolong eyebrow makeup. This product also comes in black and brown.
