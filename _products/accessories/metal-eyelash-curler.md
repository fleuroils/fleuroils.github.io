Curled eyelashes are essential to achieving the no-makeup-but-I-still-look-good look because they open up your peepers and brighten up your face. This lighweight eyelash curler is your best friend when you don’t want to mess with mascara, but it’s even better when used just before you apply mascara because it gives your eyes that va-va-voom effect. Hold the curler the way you would hold a pair of normal scissors, bring it closely enough to your eye to get all your lashes onto the rubber strip (you can rest the tip of the curler lightly against your eyelid to achieve this), and gently clamp down (don’t yank!). And don’t forget to sanitize it, as this tool still goes very near your eyes.
